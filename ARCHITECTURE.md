# Architecture Review

> Detailed review of the `home-automation` repository as of 2026-04-09.

## 1. High-Level Overview

The repository is a Go multi-module workspace (~58 modules in `go.work`) that builds a single binary (`myhome`) for home automation using Shelly IoT devices. It also supports TP-Link Tapo and SFR devices, though Shelly is the dominant focus.

```

### Binary Modes

- `myhome run` — daemon (eager MQTT, receives retained messages)
- `myhome ctl ...` — CLI (lazy MQTT, auto-connects on first RPC)

### Three-Tier Shelly Architecture

| Layer | Package | Role | LOC |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Generic API | `pkg/shelly/` + 16 sub-modules | Raw Shelly RPC, no business logic | 8,377 |
| 2. Business Logic | `internal/myhome/shelly/` | Version tracking, setup orchestration | 2,867 |
| 3. CLI | `myhome/ctl/shelly/` | Cobra commands, user output | 3,132 |

Supporting: `internal/shelly/scripts/` (324 LOC) — embedded `.js` files + version computation.

## 2. Module & Dependency Structure

### Module Naming (Fixed)

All 54 modules now use fully-qualified `github.com/asnowfix/home-automation/...` paths. This is a necessary prerequisite for external consumption, but not sufficient alone — modules still depend on `go.work` for local resolution and are not independently publishable until Phase 1 (consolidation into fewer modules) is complete.

### Dependency Graph (pkg/shelly focus)

```
pkg/shelly
├── pkg/shelly/types          (interfaces, enums)
├── pkg/shelly/mqtt           (MQTT channel)
├── pkg/shelly/shelly         (Shelly.* RPC)
├── pkg/shelly/system         (System.* RPC)
├── pkg/shelly/wifi           (WiFi.* RPC)
├── pkg/shelly/script         (Script.* RPC)
├── pkg/shelly/kvs            (KVS.* RPC)
├── pkg/shelly/sswitch        (Switch.* RPC)
├── pkg/shelly/input          (Input.* RPC)
├── pkg/shelly/ethernet       (Ethernet.* RPC)
├── pkg/shelly/matter         (Matter.* RPC)
├── pkg/shelly/schedule       (Schedule.* — module name: "schedule")
├── pkg/shelly/shttp          (HTTP channel)
├── pkg/shelly/ble            (Bluetooth Low Energy)
├── pkg/shelly/blu            (Shelly BLU)
├── pkg/shelly/gen1           (Gen1 legacy)
├── pkg/shelly/ratelimit      (rate limiter)
│
├── pkg/devices               (Device interface — external dep)
├── myhome/net                (blank import _ — side effect dep)
└── shelly/scripts            (embedded .js filesystem)
```

**External deps of pkg/shelly:** Only `logr` and `zeroconf` — very clean.

**Inward deps (leaking from myhome into pkg/shelly):**
- `_ "myhome/net"` in `device.go` — blank import for side-effect network init
- `"shelly/scripts"` in `ops.go` — embedded .js files passed to `script.Init()`
- `"schedule"` in `ops.go` and `shelly/types.go` — misnamed module for `pkg/shelly/schedule`

---

## 3. Flaws and Issues

### ~~F1. Non-Standard Module Names~~ (FIXED)

**Status: Fixed** — All 54 modules now use full `github.com/asnowfix/home-automation/...` paths. Stale replace directives (`devices`, `mymqtt`, `internal`) removed from root go.mod.

### F2. Leaky Abstraction: pkg/shelly depends on myhome internals

**Severity: High** — Violates the three-tier rule.

`pkg/shelly/device.go` imports `_ "myhome/net"` (a blank import for side-effect gateway discovery). A generic Shelly library should not depend on the application's networking layer.

`pkg/shelly/ops.go` imports `shelly/scripts` (embedded `.js` files from `internal/shelly/scripts/`). These are MyHome-specific scripts (heater, pool-pump, watchdog, etc.) — they should not be compiled into the generic library.

### ~~F3. Inconsistent Module Name: `schedule`~~ (FIXED)

**Status: Fixed** — Module renamed from `schedule` to `github.com/asnowfix/home-automation/pkg/shelly/schedule`. All imports updated.

### F4. `pkg/devices` Coupled to pkg/shelly

**Severity: Medium** — The `Device` interface in `pkg/devices` is used by `pkg/shelly` as its device abstraction. If `pkg/shelly` is extracted, `pkg/devices` must either:
- Be extracted too (into `go-shellies` or its own repo), or
- Be replaced with an interface defined within `pkg/shelly/types`

The current `pkg/devices.Device` interface is generic (Manufacturer, Id, Name, Host, Ip, Mac) and could remain as a shared interface, but the coupling adds extraction complexity.

### F5. Global Mutable State

**Severity: Medium** — Several critical components use package-level singletons:

- `pkg/shelly/registrar.go`: `var registrar Registrar` — singleton method registry
- `pkg/shelly/device.go`: `var deviceMqttRegistry` — global MQTT channel map
- `pkg/shelly/mqtt/`: `SetClient()` / `GetClient()` — global MQTT client
- `pkg/shelly/ratelimit/`: `Init()` / `GetLimiter()` — global rate limiter

This makes the library hard to test in isolation and impossible to use with multiple independent configurations (e.g., two MQTT brokers). It also complicates concurrent test execution.

### F6. Commented-Out Code Accumulation

**Severity: Low** — `device.go` contains ~50 lines of commented-out code (lines 168-206, 684-714). Similarly, `registrar.go` has commented-out methods. This code should be removed or tracked in issues.

### F7. Panic-Driven Error Handling

**Severity: Medium** — Several functions in `pkg/shelly/device.go` call `panic()` for conditions that should return errors:
- `UpdateId()` panics on invalid ID
- `UpdateMac()` panics on empty MAC
- `init()` panics if info is nil
- `initMqtt()` panics if device ID is empty

A library should never panic — it should return errors and let the caller decide.

### F8. `fmt.Printf` in Library Code

**Severity: Low-Medium** — `pkg/shelly/device.go` `Foreach()` uses `fmt.Printf` for user-facing output (lines 827-834). A generic library should use structured logging or callbacks — not write directly to stdout. This mixes CLI concerns into the API layer.

### F9. Excessive Module Granularity

**Severity: Medium** — `pkg/shelly` has **16 separate Go modules** for what could be sub-packages of a single module. Each sub-module has its own `go.mod`, requiring individual dependency management and `replace` directives. This creates:
- 16× `go.mod` files to maintain per dependency update
- 16× entries in `go.work`
- Complex `replace` chains in any consuming `go.mod`

Most mature Go libraries (e.g., `google.golang.org/grpc`) ship as a single module with sub-packages.

### F10. Missing Test Coverage

**Severity: Medium** — Key packages lack tests:
- `pkg/shelly/device.go` — core device logic, no tests
- `pkg/shelly/registrar.go` — method registry, no tests
- `pkg/shelly/ops.go` — initialization, no tests
- `pkg/shelly/config.go` — device configuration, no tests
- Most sub-packages under `pkg/shelly/` (kvs, system, wifi, ethernet, etc.) have no test files

Only `pkg/shelly/script/` and `pkg/shelly/mqtt/` have test coverage.

### F11. Tight Coupling Between Init and Embedded Scripts

**Severity: Medium** — `pkg/shelly/ops.go:Init()` calls `script.Init(log, &registrar, scripts.GetFS())` passing the embedded filesystem from `internal/shelly/scripts/`. This means the generic library's initialization requires MyHome-specific scripts. The embedded filesystem should be passed by the application, not baked into the library init.

### F12. MQTT Client as Global Singleton

**Severity: Medium** — `pkg/shelly/mqtt.SetClient()` sets a global MQTT client that all devices share. There's no way to use different MQTT brokers for different device sets or to inject a mock client for testing without affecting global state.

### F13. Mixed Concerns in `Foreach()`

**Severity: Low** — `pkg/shelly/device.go:Foreach()` combines:
- Device filtering (skip Gen1, skip BLU)
- Device instantiation (NewDeviceFromSummary + init)
- Parallel execution with WaitGroup
- Error aggregation
- User-facing output formatting (fmt.Printf)

This should be decomposed: filtering and output belong at the application layer.

## 4. Strengths

- **Clean three-tier separation** (when respected) — the conceptual architecture is sound
- **Minimal external dependencies** in pkg/shelly — only `logr` + `zeroconf`
- **Well-documented conventions** in CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md
- **Goroutine leak prevention** — DeviceMqttChannels registry is thoughtfully designed
- **Rate limiting** — per-device request queuing prevents overwhelming devices
- **Channel abstraction** — HTTP/MQTT/UDP channels are cleanly separated via the Registrar
- **Comprehensive CLI** — rich set of device management commands
